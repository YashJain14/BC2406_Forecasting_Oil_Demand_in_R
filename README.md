**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</span>**

Aramco saw impressive financial growth in 2022 but faced a 19% drop in net income in early 2023 due to fluctuating oil demand influenced by various factors. To address the challenge of fluctuating demand, we aim to develop a machine learning model to forecast monthly oil demand. This model will enhance decision-making and help Aramco adapt to changing market dynamics while aligning with its climate change commitments.

To develop these models, we used publicly available crude oil export data from Saudi Arabia as a metric for total demand from Aramco’s customers. To forecast oil exports from Saudi Arabia, we applied linear regression, Vector AutoRegression (VAR), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. The variables used in predicting oil exports are Saudi Arabia’s oil production, oil exchange open price, oil trading volume, Aramco’s stock price, geopolitical influences, and crude oil imports to China, India, Japan, the USA, and Korea.

A key finding from the datasets we analysed was that the GDP growth rates of large economies like India and China were positively correlated with global demand for oil. We further learnt that high oil demand was correlated to high oil prices and high Aramco stock prices.

The machine learning models we developed are a Proof of Concept for Aramco to consider. They have been shown via testing to be reasonably good predictors of oil demand. The implementation and further refinement of these models would result in several positive business outcomes. Accurate demand prediction would increase Aramco’s operational efficiency, reduce oil price volatility, and enhance decision-making. 

Aramco should also address the limitations of the models and adapt them according to their goals and needs to enhance their value and effectiveness in improving Aramco’s business outcomes.
